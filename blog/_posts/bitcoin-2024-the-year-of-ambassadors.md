The previous year stands out as a transformative period for BTCPay Server. It is filled with significant achievements that have fortified the project. We deployed the BTCPay Point of Sale system at multiple events, demonstrating how [FOSS technology on top of Bitcoin can rival and even replace traditional fiat payment rails](https://twitter.com/BtcpayServer/status/1704874856452366696). We [announced the BTCPay App](https://twitter.com/BtcpayServer/status/1699114457421447543), a cornerstone of our long-term strategy. Our partnerships have flourished - we released numerous [case studies highlighting the innovative work of those building on top of BTCPay Server](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3Abtcpayserver%20case%20study\&src=typed_query). Finally, our supporters have come through to ensure we can continue working on FOSS technology that is available to everyone.

At BTCPay our mission is to enable anyone to accept Bitcoin, unhindered by geographic, political, or financial barriers. As we step into 2024, we’re dedicated to helping individuals and businesses build **circular economies on top of Bitcoin**. We’re not here to just provide the technology; we're here to nurture relationships and offer dedicated support to those who share our vision. We believe in the power of collective effort and that local communities can have a global impact.
