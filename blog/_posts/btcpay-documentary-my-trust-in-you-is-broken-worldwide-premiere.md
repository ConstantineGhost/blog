### Description for Press

"My Trust In You Is Broken" is a Feature Documentary by [Parker Worthington](https://twitter.com/webworthy). It chronicles the tumultuous origins of Bitcoin as a payments system and highlights Nicolas Dorier's significant role. Reacting against BitPay's direction in the Bitcoin Block Size Wars and their support for SegWit2x, Dorier created BTCPay Server. This free, open-source platform allows merchants to accept Bitcoin directly and independence from intermediaries. Despite the ambiguity in its adoption scale, BTCPay Server is known for its community-driven model, privacy, and autonomy features. The film emphasizes Dorier's pivotal role in contributing to Bitcoin merchant adoption and the perils of trusted third parties.
